# QuasiBootsMedian
Quasi-boots meidan method for MR analyses  
  
Please source the script median_boots.R in R, and use function: median_boots(bx,bxse,by,byse,cormat,same_population, IV_list, boots_iteration = 10000, seed=314159265) to run quasi-boots median method.  
  
Input:  
bx: genetic association with exposure  
bxse: standard error of genetic association with exposure  
by:genetic association with outcome  
byse:standard error of genetic association with outcome  
cormat:genetic correlation matrix, please add colnames and rownames as genetic variants names for this matrix (matching IV_list)  
IV_list: genetic variants names (make sure the order for bx, bxse, by and byse matches this list)  
same_population: True if one-sample MR; False if two-sample MR  
boots_iteration: number of iterations for the bootstrap, default is 10000  
seed: random seed, default is 314159265
